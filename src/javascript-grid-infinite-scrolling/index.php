    <h2 id="virtual-paging-infinite-scrolling">Infinite Scrolling Row Model</h2>

    <p>
        Infinite scrolling allows the grid to lazy load rows from the server depending on what
        the scroll position is of the grid. In its simplest form, the more the user scrolls
        down, the more rows get loaded.
    </p>
    <p>
        The grid will have an 'auto extending' vertical scroll. That means as the scroll reaches
        the bottom position, the grid will extend the height to allow scrolling even further down,
        almost making it impossible for the user to reach the bottom. This will stop happening
        once the grid has extended the scroll to reach the last record in the table.
    </p>

    <h3 id="how-it-works">How it Works</h3>

    <p>
        The following diagram is a high level overview:
    </p>

    <p>
        <img src="high-level.png"/>
    </p>

    <p>
        The row model behind the grid contains a cache of pages. Each page contains a subset of the entire data set.
        When the grid scrolls to a position where there is no corresponding page in the cache, the model
        uses the provided datasource (you provide the datasource) to get the rows for the requested page. In the diagram,
        the datasource is getting the rows from a database in a remote server.
    </p>

    <h3 id="turning-on-virtual-paging">Turning On Infinite Scrolling</h3>

    <p>
        To turn on infinite scrolling, you must a) set the grid property rowModelType to infinite and b) provide a datasource.
    </p>

    <pre><span class="codeComment">// before grid initialised</span>
gridOptions.rowModelType = 'infinite';
gridOptions.datasource = myDataSource;

<span class="codeComment">// after grid initialised, you can set or change the datasource</span>
gridOptions.api.setDatasource(myDataSource);</pre>

    <h2 id="datasource">Datasource</h2>

    <p>
        A datasource must be provided to do infinite scrolling. You specify the datasource as a grid property
        or using the grid API.
    </p>

    <pre><span class="codeComment">// set as a property</span>
gridOptions.datasource = myDatasource;

<span class="codeComment">// or use the api after the grid is initialised</span>
gridOptions.api.setDatasource(myDatasource);</pre>

    <h3 id="changing-a-datasource">Changing the Datasource</h3>

    <p>
        Changing the datasource after the grid is initialised will reset the paging in the grid. This is useful if the context of your
        data changes, ie if you want to look at a different set of data.
    </p>

    <note>
        If you call <i>setDatasource()</i> the grid will act assuming
        it's a new datasource, resetting the paging. However you can pass in the same datasource instance.
        So your application, for example, might have one instance of a datasource that is aware of some
        external context (eg the business date selected for a report, or the 'bank ATM instance' data you are
        connecting to), and when the context changes, you want to reset, but still keep the same datasource
        instance. In this case, just call setDatasource() and pass the same datasource in again.
    </note>

    <h3 id="the-datasource-object">Datasource Interface</h3>

    <p>
        In a nutshell, every time the grid wants more rows, it will call <i>getRows()</i> on the datasource.
        The datasource responds with the rows requested. Your datasource for infinite scrolling should
        implement the following interface:
    </p>

    <pre><span class="codeComment">// Infinite Scrolling Datasource</span>
interface IDatasource {

    <span class="codeComment">// Callback the grid calls that you implement to fetch rows from the server. See below for params.</span>
    getRows(params: IGetRowsParams): void;
}</pre>

    <p>
        The getRows() method takes the following parameters:
    </p>

    <pre><span class="codeComment">// Params for the above IDatasource.getRows()</span>
interface IGetRowsParams {

    <span class="codeComment">// The first row index to get.</span>
    startRow: number;

    <span class="codeComment">// The first row index to NOT get.</span>
    endRow: number;

    <span class="codeComment">// If doing server side sorting, contains the sort model</span>
    sortModel: any,

    <span class="codeComment">// If doing server side filtering, contains the filter model</span>
    filterModel: any;

    <span class="codeComment">// The grid context object</span>
    context: any;

    <span class="codeComment">// Callback to call for the result when successful.</span>
    successCallback(rowsThisPage: any[], lastRow?: number): void;

    <span class="codeComment">// Callback to call for the result when successful.</span>
    failCallback(): void;
}</pre>

    <h3 id="function-get-rows">Function getRows()</h3>

    <p>
        The <i>getRows()</i> function is called by the grid to load pages into the browser side cache of pages.
        It takes the following as parameters:
        <ul>
            <li>
                The <b>startRow</b> and <b>endRow</b> define the range expected for the call. For example, if page
                size is 100, the getRows function will be called with start = 0 and end = 100 and the
                grid will expect a result with 100 rows, that's rows 0..99.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <b>successCallback(rowsThisBlock, lastRowIndex)</b> should be called when you successfully receive data
                from the server. The callback has the following parameters:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>rowsThisBlock</b> should be the rows you have received for the current block.</li>
                    <li><b>lastRow</b> should be the index of the last row if known.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                The <b>failCallback()</b> should be called if the loading failed. Either one of
                successCallback() or failCallback() should be called exactly once.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <a href="../javascript-grid-context/"><b>context</b></a> is just passed as is
                an nothing to do with infinite scrolling. It's there if you need it for providing
                application state.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Setting Last Row Index</h3>

    <p>
        The success callback parameter <b>lastRow</b> is used to move the grid out of infinite scrolling.
        If the last row is known, then this should be the index of the last row. If the last row is unknown,
        then leave blank (undefined, null or -1). This attribute is only used when in infinite scrolling / paging.
        Once the total record count is known, the <i>lastRow</i> parameter will be ignored.
    </p>

    <h3 id="page-size">Block Size</h3>

    <p>
        The block size is set using the grid property <i>infiniteBlockSize</i>. This is how large the 'pages' should be.
        Each call to your datasource will be for one block.
    </p>

    <h3 id="aggregation-and-grouping">Aggregation and Grouping</h3>

    <p>
        Aggregation and grouping are not available in infinite scrolling.
        This is because to do such would require the grid knowing the entire data set,
        which is not possible when using the infinite row model. If you need aggregation and / or
        grouping for large datasets, check the <a href="../javascript-grid-enterprise-model/">Enterprise
        Row Model</a> for doing aggregations on the server side.
    </p>

    <h3 id="sorting-filtering">Sorting & Filtering</h3>

    <p>
        The grid cannot do sorting or filtering for you, as it does not have all of the data. 
        Sorting or filtering must be done on the server side. For this reason, if the sort or filter
        changes, the grid will use the datasource to get the data again and provide the sort and filter
        state to you.
    </p>

    <h3 id="simple-example-no-sorting-or-filtering">Simple Example - No Sorting or Filtering</h3>

    <p>
        The example below shows infinite scrolling. The example makes use of infinite scrolling and caching.
        Notice that the grid will load more data when you bring the scroll all the way to the bottom.
    </p>

    <show-example example="exampleInfinite"></show-example>

    <h3 id="selection">Selection</h3>

    <p>
        Selection works on the rows in infinite scrolling by using the ID of the row node. If you do not
        provide ID's for the row nodes, the index of the row node will be used. Using the index of the
        row breaks down when (server side) filtering or sorting, as these change the index of the rows.
        For this reason, if you do not provide your own id's, then selection is cleared if sort or
        filter is changed.
    </p>

    <p>
        To provide your own id's, implement the method <i>getRowNodeId(data)</i>, which takes the data
        and should return the id for the data.
    </p>

    <pre>gridOptions.getRowNodeId: function(item) {
    <span class="codeComment">// the id can be any string, as long as it's unique within your dataset</span>
    return item.id.toString();
}</pre>

    <p>
        Once you have <i>getRowNodeId</i> implemented, selection will persist across sorts and filters.
    </p>

    <h3 id="example-sorting-filtering-and-selection">Example - Sorting, Filtering and Selection</h3>

    <p>
        The following example extends the example above by adding server side sorting, filtering and
        persistent selection.
    </p>

    <p>
        Any column can be sorted by clicking the header. When this happens, the datasource is called
        again with the new sort options.
    </p>

    <p>
        The columns <b><i>Age</i></b>, <b><i>Country</i></b> and <b><i>Year</i></b> can be filtered.
        When this happens, the datasource is called again with the new filtering options.
    </p>

    <p>
        When a row is selected, the selection will remain inside the grid, even if the grid gets sorted
        or filtered. Notice that when the grid loads a selected row (eg select first row, scroll down
        so first page is removed form cache, then scroll back up again) the row is not highlighted
        until the row is loaded from the server. This is because the grid is waiting to see what the id
        is of the row to be loaded.
    </p>

    <p>
        (note: the example below uses ag-Grid-Enterprise, this is to demonstrate the set filter with server side filtering,
        ag-Grid-Enterprise is not required for infinite scrolling)
    </p>

    <p>
        The examples above use old style JavaScript objects for the datasource. This example turns things around slightly
        and creates a datasource Class. The example also just creates (makes up) data on the fly.

    <h3 id="loading-spinner">Loading Spinner</h3>

    <p>
        The examples on this page use a loading spinner to show if the row is waiting for it's data to be loaded. The
        grid does not provide this, rather it is a simple rendering technique used in the examples. If the data
        is loading, then the rowNode will be missing data, and hence all values passed to cellRenderers will be
        undefined. You can check for this and provide your own loading effect.
    </p>

    <pre>cellRenderer: function(params) {
    if (params.value !== undefined) {
        return params.value;
    } else {
        return '&lt;img src="../images/loading.gif">'
    }
}</pre>

    <h3 id="more-control-via-properties-and-api">More Control via Properties and API</h3>

    <p>
        Infinite scrolling has a cache working behind the scenes. The following properties and API are provided
        to allow you control of the cache.

                    need to be consistent with what is inside the grid. Doing an insert will require rows to be moved
                    after the insert location (pushed down to make room) - this can leave blank rows in pages in the cache
                    (if a page has to be moved down, and the previous page is not loaded for it to take rows from). If this

                    maintain even if you get it right, especially in multi-user environments. It is strongly suggested you
                    don't use the insertItemsAtIndex() method, rather you update the source and then refresh the cache.

    <h4 id="adding-removing-summary">&#8226; Adding / Removing Summary</h4>

    <p>
        Adding / removing rows directly in the grid for infinite scrolling is in general bad news as you are
        giving a viewport and scrolling through data that resides on the server. It is better to update the
        data on the server and refresh the page cache.

            <b>Inject 1 Row @ 2 / Inject 5 Row @ 2</b>: Inserts either one or five rows at location index 2.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Insert 1 Row @ 2 and Refresh</b>: Inserts five rows at location index 2 and then gets grid to refresh.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Delete 10 Rows @ 3</b>: Deletes rows from the server, then gets the grid to refresh.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Set Row Count to 200</b>: Sets the row count to 200. This adjusts the vertical scroll to
            show 200 rows. If the scroll is positioned at the end, this results in the grid automatically readjusting
            as it seeks ahead for the next page of data.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Print Rows and Max Found</b>: Debugging method, prints rowCount and maxFound to the console.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Jump to 500</b>: Positions the grid so that row 500 is displayed.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Print Cache State</b>: Debugging method, to see the state of the cache.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Set Prices High & Set Prices Low</b>: Sets the prices ON THE SERVER SIDE to either high or low prices.
            This will not impact the grid until after a page cache is loaded. Use these buttons then then further
            test the refresh and purge methods.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Refresh Cache</b>: Calls for the cache to be refreshed.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Purge Cache</b>: Calls for the cache to be purged.
        </li>
    </ul>

    The example also makes each Honda row bold - demonstrating that the callbacks getRowStyle and getRowClass
    get called after the data is set as well as when the row is created (when the data may not yet be available).

    <h2 id="pagination">Pagination with Infinite Scrolling</h2>

    <p>
        As with all row models, it is possible to enable pagination with infinite scrolling.
        With infinite scrolling, it is possible to mix and match with the configuration to
        achieve different effects. The following examples are presented:

        <table class="table">
            <tr>
                <th>Example</th>
                <th>Page Size</th>
                <th>Block Size</th>
                <th>Comment</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Example 1</td>
                <td>Auto</td>
                <td>Large</td>
                <td>Most Recommended</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Example 2</td>
                <td>Equal</td>
                <td>Equal</td>
                <td>Recommended Sometimes</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

    </p>

    <note>
        <p><b>Having smaller infinite blocks size than your paginatino page size is not supported</b></p>
        <p>
            You must have infinite block size greater than or equal to the pagination page size.
            If you have a smaller block size, the grid will not fetch enough rows to display
            one page. This breaks how infinite scrolling works and is not supported.
        </p>
    </note>

    <h3>Example 1: Auto Pagination Page Size, Large Infinite Block Size</h3>

    <p>
        This example is the recommended approach. The infinite block size is larger than the pages size,
        so the grid loads data for a few pages, allowing the user to hit 'next' a few times before a server
        sided call is needed.

                                ]

    </show-complex-example>

    <h3>Example 2: Equal Pagination Page Size and Large Infinite Block Size</h3>

    <p>
        This example demonstrates having the page and block sizes equal. Here the server is hit
        every time a new page is navigated to.
