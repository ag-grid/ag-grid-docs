    <p>The status bar appears below the grid. When used in combination with the range selection it displays
    aggregation data about the selected range giving the following: average, count, min, max, sum.</p>

    <p>If you have multiple ranges selected (by holding down ctrl while dragging) and a cell is in multiple
    ranges, the cell will be only included once in the aggregations.</p>

    <p>If the cell does not contain a simple number value, then it will not be included in average, min max or sum,
    however it will be included in count.</p>

    <p>In the grid below, select a range by dragging the mouse over cells and notice the status bar
    showing the aggregation values as you drag.</p>
