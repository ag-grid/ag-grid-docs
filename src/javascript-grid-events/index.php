    <h2 id="events">Events</h2>


    <p>
        Below are listed all the events of the grid you can listen to. The events are asynchronously so that the state
        of the grid will be settled by the time your event callback gets invoked.
    <p>

    <note>
        Events in ag-Grid became asynchronous in version 10.0.0. Before this, events were not asynchronous and you
        were not guaranteed the grid was finished before the event was fired. The new method of asynchronous events
        makes the grid work much better with systems designed around state and events, eg React.

            <note>
                For AngularJS 1.x - ag-Grid does not not fire events inside an Angular JS digest
                cycle. This is done on purpose
                for performance reasons, as there are many events fired, even if you don't listen to them. Firing the digest
                cycle
                for each one would kill performance. So you may want to $scope.$apply() after you handle the event.
