            <a data-toggle="collapse" href="javascript:void(0);" data-target="#answer_1">What is the difference between Single Application Developer License and Multiple Application Developer License?</a>
        </div>

        <div class="answer collapse" id="answer_1">
            <p>
                Single Application developer license ties the license to one particular application within your organisation.
                A typical example is 5 licenses to cover an application with 5 developers working concurrently on it.
                This is best if you a) have only one (or a fixed number) of applications you need to license or b) you
                want to charge the license to a particular project(s).
            </p>

            <p>
                Multiple Application developer license allows unlimited applications to be developed by a fixed number of developers.
                A typical example is 5 license to cover an unlimited number of applications with 5 developers working
                across all applications concurrently. Use Multiple Application license if you want to cover a group
                of developers developing any number of applications.

            <p>
            No. If you license an application you provide the number of developers working on that application.
            We trust that you do not go over the number of concurrent developers on that application at any
            given time. Developers moving on and off projects is expected to be normal.

                The perpetual nature of the Enterprise license means you can continue to use the version of
                ag-Grid Enterprise, plus any release for one year, indefinitely. There is no requirement to
                pay again to continue using the software. However if you wish to keep up to date with the
                latest versions of ag-Grid after one year and continue with support, you must extend the
                license.
